Note: This site is still in development - what you see is just a prototype of what will become the official Lumi Solutions website.

What We Do
We're a tech company specializing in hosting solutions, tech consulting, SIP trunking, VoIP, and other IT services. This project showcases what we offer using Bootstrap 4.

Website Sections
Navigation & Header
Our responsive navbar works on all devices and includes a dropdown menu that collapses to a hamburger menu on phones. You can navigate to any section from here.

Banner
The top section introduces visitors to Lumi Solutions with a clean design and clear message about what we offer.

Carousels
We've included two types:

Single item carousel showing our tech solutions with high-quality images
Multi-item carousel displaying our services (shows 4 cards on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile)
Dropdown Menu
Added this for easy navigation to our hosting solutions page. It's user-friendly and keeps track of what you've selected.

Aside Section
This section shows complementary content next to the main info. It adjusts based on screen size so it looks good on all devices.

Free Section
I added a customizable area that can be updated as needed. It's fully responsive like the rest of the site.

Footer
Basic footer with social links and copyright info. Nothing fancy but gets the job done.

How It's Built
I built this using:

Bootstrap 4 for the responsive layout
Minimal custom CSS (tried to use Bootstrap classes where possible)
Mobile-first approach so it works on all devices
Accessibility features so everyone can use it
What's Next
This is just phase one. I'm planning to add:

Better UI elements
More service pages
Customer testimonials
Pricing calculator
Chat support
